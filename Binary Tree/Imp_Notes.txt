🧠 What You Got Right (And It's Important!):
“So one thing I get to learn is that there is no need or never we have to convert a tree into array and just solve as it is.”

✅ Yes! That’s the core idea.

In real-world and competitive programming:

We traverse trees directly via pointers, not arrays.

Converting to an array is only used for special cases (like heaps, segment trees, or serialization).
