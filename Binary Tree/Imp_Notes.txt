🧠 What You Got Right (And It's Important!):
“So one thing I get to learn is that there is no need or never we have to convert a tree into array and just solve as it is.”

✅ Yes! That’s the core idea.

In real-world and competitive programming:
We traverse trees directly via pointers, not arrays.
Converting to an array is only used for special cases (like heaps, segment trees, or serialization).




🧠 1. What is a Binary Tree?
A tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure.

A Binary Tree is a tree where each node has at most 2 children — left and right.

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};



🧩 3. Tree Traversals (Core to 90% problems)

✅ DFS (Depth-First Search)
Inorder (L, N, R)
Left → Node → Right
For BST: gives sorted order

Preorder (N, L, R)
Node → Left → Right
Used to serialize tree (or reconstruct with inorder)

Postorder (L, R, N)
Left → Right → Node
Used in deletion, bottom-up DP

✅ BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Also called Level Order Traversal
Uses queue
Helps with views (left/right/top) & level-based processing




⚙️ 4. Tree Construction (From Traversals)
You can build trees if you’re given:

Inorder + Preorder
Inorder + Postorder

🔁 Use recursion + array slicing or index maps for this.



🧠 5. Recursive Structure of Trees
Every Tree problem is basically:

int solve(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return base_case;

    int left = solve(root->left);
    int right = solve(root->right);

    // combine left & right to form result
    return result;
}
This “postorder-style thinking” is key.



🪜 6. Patterns to Recognize Early

| Pattern / Use   | Example Problems              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| DFS traversal   | Inorder, Preorder, Postorder  |
| BFS traversal   | Level order, Zigzag, Views    |
| Combine returns | Diameter, LCA, Max path sum   |
| Return boolean  | Path Sum, Symmetry            |
| Modify in-place | Invert Tree, Flatten Tree     |
| Use map/hash    | Construct Tree, View problems |



🧠 7. Think Like a Tree
To master trees, don’t treat them like arrays or graphs.

🔁 For each node:
"What should I do before recursion?" (Preorder)
"What do I do between left and right?" (Inorder)
"What do I do after recursion?" (Postorder)
