No, Level Order Traversal is not done using recursion by default.


🧠 Why?
Level order means visiting nodes level-by-level, from top to bottom.
This is naturally handled by a queue, which processes elements in the order they were added (FIFO).
Recursion is inherently depth-first, not level-by-level.


🔁 But Can Level Order Be Done Recursively?
Yes! But it's more complex and not interview-friendly.
It involves:
Computing height of the tree
For each level from 1 to height, calling a recursive function to print that level
That’s inefficient (O(n²)) and not commonly used.
