âœ… 1. Preorder (Node â†’ Left â†’ Right)
You use Preorder when:
You need to do something at the current node first, like:
Counting nodes
Adding to a path
Pushing to a result before recursion

âœ… 2. Inorder (Left â†’ Node â†’ Right)
You use Inorder when:
You're working with BSTs and want elements in sorted order.
You want to do something in a linear/ordered way, like:
Validating BST property
Getting kth smallest/largest element in BST

âœ… 3. Postorder (Left â†’ Right â†’ Node)
You use Postorder when:
You need to compute something based on results from both children, such as:
Height of a tree âœ…
Diameter of a tree
Evaluating expression trees
Deleting nodes (clean up from leaves up)



ðŸ”¥ Final Pro Tip:
In tree problems:
If youâ€™re collecting a path, counting depth during walk â†’ likely Preorder
If youâ€™re deciding based on child results (like max/min) â†’ use Postorder
Inorder is mostly for BST-specific or sorted output tasks
