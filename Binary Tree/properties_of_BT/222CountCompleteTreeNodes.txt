A helper function is a function that performs a specific part of a task for another,
Its main job is to make the primary function's code simpler, cleaner, and easier to understand.



The reason we use helper functions isn't about doing something different,
but about doing it smarter and cleaner, especially as your projects get bigger.
Think of it as the difference between putting all your 
clothes in one giant pile on the floor versus organizing them in a dresser with different drawers. ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘–



class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root)return 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        helper(root, cnt);
        return cnt + 1;
    }
    void helper(TreeNode* root, int& cnt) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return;

        if (root->left){
            cnt++;
            helper(root->left, cnt);
        }
        if (root->right){
            cnt++;
            helper(root->right, cnt);
        }
    }
};
