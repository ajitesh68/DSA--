✅ 1. map[key] = value — Assignment
This overwrites the current value of the key with a new one.

If the key is already present, its value is replaced.

If the key does not exist, it's created and assigned value.

🔍 Example:
map<int, int> mp;
mp[1] = 5;   // inserts key 1 with value 5
mp[1] = 10;  // overwrites value → now mp[1] = 10


✅ 2. map[key] += value — Increment / Accumulate
This adds value to the current value at the key.

If the key does not exist, it is automatically initialized to 0, and then value is added.

🔍 Example:
map<int, int> mp;
mp[1] += 5;   // key 1 doesn't exist → initialized to 0 → becomes 5
mp[1] += 10;  // adds 10 → now mp[1] = 15
