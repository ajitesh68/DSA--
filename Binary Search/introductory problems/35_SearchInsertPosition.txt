very simple problem. Just have to return (low) index as that would give the exact position where we have to insert value


class Solution {
public:
   int searchInsert(vector<int>& arr, int m)
{
	int low =0,high=arr.size()-1;
	int mid;
	while(low<=high)
	{
		mid=low+(high-low)/2;
        if(arr[mid]==m)return mid;
		else if(arr[mid]<m)low=mid+1;
		else high=mid-1;
	}

	return low;
}
};
