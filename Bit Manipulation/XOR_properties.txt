We need to solve for a1. How can we do that?

Recall that XOR has some useful properties:

A XOR A = 0

A XOR 0 = A

XOR is associative and commutative.

If A XOR B = C, then A XOR C = B and B XOR C = A.

Given e0 = a0 XOR a1, we can XOR both sides with a0:
a0 XOR e0 = a0 XOR (a0 XOR a1)
a0 XOR e0 = (a0 XOR a0) XOR a1 (by associativity)
a0 XOR e0 = 0 XOR a1
a0 XOR e0 = a1

So, a1 = a0 XOR e0.




‚úÖ The 4 Core XOR Properties You Must Know:
These are like the ‚Äúlaws of physics‚Äù for XOR ‚Äî every XOR problem relies on them.

Property	Meaning
a ^ a = 0	Any number XOR itself is 0
a ^ 0 = a	Any number XOR 0 stays the same
XOR is commutative	a ^ b = b ^ a
XOR is associative	(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)

üí° That‚Äôs all the math ‚Äî the rest is insight and pattern recognition.
Let me give you a simple breakdown:

üß† You only need these 4 XOR facts...
But:

üîç To solve problems, you have to spot:
What values are cancelling each other (a ^ a = 0)
What value is left over (0 ^ x = x)
