🔍 Step 1: What is a “Permutation” Array?
A permutation of the first n positive integers is just a shuffled version of [1, 2, ..., n].

✅ Properties of a Permutation:
It contains every number from 1 to n exactly once.
No repetition.
No missing number.
Only rearrangement.

🧠 Example:
If n = 5, then perm could be any of:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
