was able to think how to solve and also configure the logic but took some help in clarification




class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int back = num;
        int ind_msb = 0;
        while(num > 1){
            num = num >> 1;
            ind_msb++;
        }
        int mask = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<=ind_msb; i++){
            mask = (mask << 1) | 1;
        }
        return (back ^ mask);
    }
};
