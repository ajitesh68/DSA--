Let's trace your [4,1,2,1,2] example:

The operation is 4 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2.

Since the order doesn't matter, you can think of it as grouping the pairs:
4 ^ (1 ^ 1) ^ (2 ^ 2)

The pairs cancel out to zero:

(1 ^ 1) becomes 0

(2 ^ 2) becomes 0



((((((wasnt able to do on own not even build the logic but this is perfect example for showing 
                canceling out property))))))
