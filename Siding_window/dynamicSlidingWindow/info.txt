Core Logic ðŸ§ 
Initialize: Set left = 0, right = 0, an answer variable, and a hash map to track the
 window's state.

Expand ðŸ‘‰: Loop the right pointer from start to end, adding collection[right] to the 
hash map.

Shrink ðŸ‘ˆ: Inside the loop, use a while loop to check if the window is invalid. 
If it is, remove collection[left] from the hash map and increment left until the window 
is valid again.

Update âœ…: After each valid step, calculate the window's current size (right - left + 1) 
and update your answer if it's better than the previous best.
