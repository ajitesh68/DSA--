🔁 When and How to Think of Two Pointers
🔍 Recognize the Clue:
"The arrays are already sorted by ID"

This one line is the trigger that should instantly make you think:
"If two arrays are sorted, maybe I can walk through them together instead of scanning them again and again."



📌 General Cases Where Two Pointers Work:
| Situation                                | Trigger to Use Two Pointers              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Two sorted arrays                        | Walk both together like merge sort       |
| Finding pairs with sum (in sorted array) | One pointer at start, one at end         |
| Removing duplicates                      | Fast and slow pointer                    |
| Merging intervals                        | Sort and process overlapping intervals   |
| Sliding window / subarrays               | Expand & contract window with 2 pointers |



🎯 Mindset to Ask Yourself in Future
✅ Are arrays/lists sorted?
✅ Can I traverse from both ends or in sync?
✅ Can I process one pass instead of nested loops?
✅ Am I repeating operations that can be handled on the fly?


✅ Summary:
Sorted inputs → think two pointers
Merging, comparing, pairing, or removing duplicates in sorted data → strong candidate
Try brute force first, then ask: “Am I redoing work that sorted order can help with?”
